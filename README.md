# Engineering-Salary-Prediction
In India there are around 6000+ engineering institues in which 2.9 million students get enrolled of which only 1.5 million students get their degree and only 20% get employment in their specific domain due to lack of skills.
The aim of my project is to predict salaries of the engineer graduates in India based on factors like their specialization, college grades, skills etc.
